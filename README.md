# Active-Clinical-Drug-Trial-Database-modelling
The Database will store clinical trials and outcomes through data modelled around a complex relationship of multiple entities.  A pharma company houses a Clinical Trial for one or more of their new drugs. This is a multi-step process which is based on the research carried out by the scientists and administered to the patients under the supervision of the doctors. The test samples are unique for every patient and form the basis of whether the drug passes the clinical trial or not.  Moreover, the database also gives a geographical context of where the companies are conducting trials in USA by keeping a track of the state wise clinical trials. The Estimated cost of every trial logged in by the database gives an idea as to which company is spending how much and on what drug.  Ultimately, this database is modelled to aid regulatory professionals, medical practitioners and clinical research investigators for evidence based decision making or perhaps as a tool in getting clinical trial information.
